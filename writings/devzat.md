## unformatted writings for devzat ssh chat
devzat is the name of an ssh chat room written in go by a person named Ishan Goel, if you ever want to connect to the chat all you need to do is open up command prompt or a terminal, generate an ssh key with the command `ssh-keygen` and then you just connect with `ssh username@devzat.hackclub.com`, if that doesn't work and errors out for absolutely no reason then connect with port 443 with the command `ssh username@devzat.hackclub.com -p 443` using that port somehow bypasses the requirement for a key so all good.
